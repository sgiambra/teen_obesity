^Estimates panel IV models using 2SLS within estimator^
.-

Full syntax:

^aivreg^ depvar [ varlist_1 ] (varlist_2 = varlist_iv) [if], ^absorb^(varname) ///
        [ ^robust^ ^cluster^(varname) ]
        
Options:

^absorb^(varname)        Categorical variable to be absorbed via within transformation
^robust^                 Use robust (i.e., Eicker-White) VCE
^cluster^(varname)       Use cluster-robust VCE clustered by varname
^dfadj_absorb^           Force areg-style DOF adjustment. See below for details

Notes: 

The ^absorb^(varname) option is required. varlist_1 and varlist_iv may contain factor variables. 
depvar, varlist_1, varlist_2, and varlist_iv may contain time-series operators. 

^Description^

^aivreg^ estimates panel IV models using the 2SLS within estimator. Its primary feature is
that it can replicate the output of its Stata-official counterpart ^xtivreg, fe^ (and other
third-party commands such as ^xtivreg2, fe^) in considerably less run-time.

Details regarding DOF adjustments applied to cluster-robust VCE:

Let N be the number of observations in the estimation sample, K the number of included 
regressors (including a constant), and M the number of distinct values of the fixed effects
variable that we hope to partial out of the model via the within transformation. 

When clustering, ^xtreg, fe^ and ^xtivreg, fe^ both require that the fixed effects be nested 
within clusters (i.e., that each fixed effect appears in only one cluster). Both commands apply 
the following DOF adjustment:

            DOF_ADJ_XTREG = N / (N - K)
            
^areg^, by contrast, does not require that the fixed effects be nested within clusters. It 
applies the following DOF adjustment:

            DOF_ADJ_AREG  = N / (N - K - M + 1)

regardless of whether the fixed effects are nested within clusters.

Following these conventions, the default behavior of ^aivreg^ is to employ DOF_ADJ_XTREG if the
fixed effects are nested within clusters and DOF_ADJ_AREG if the fixed effects are not nested 
within clusters. The ^dfadj_absorb^ option allows users to override this behavior and employ 
DOF_ADJ_AREG when the fixed effects are nested within clusters. Note, however, that consistent 
with Stata conventions, users cannot employ DOF_ADJ_XTREG when the fixed effects are not nested 
within clusters.
